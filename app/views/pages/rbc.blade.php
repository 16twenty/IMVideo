				RBC Avion is a flexible, easy-to-understand travel rewards card that truly delivers. RBC wanted several short clips of people enjoying Avion Rewards at the 2014 Bluesfest. The clips would then be uploaded to their new Facebook page in order to gain some traction amongst internet savvy individuals and to promote their Avion VIP Lounges (designated areas for Avion members at different events and venues).

				Our quick turnaround allowed the client to "live-stream" about Avion members, virtually as we were filming. This allowed people to be invested in the videos as they were being created, ensuring mass adoption on Facebook because they were all interested in seeing the videos they were in. In just over 2 months since the event, RBC has garnered over 10K Likes on Facebook.
